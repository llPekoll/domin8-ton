## Key Features

### Game Mechanics

#### Waiting State (Map Carousel)

When no game is active, players see a **map carousel**:
- **Spinning Carousel**: Maps rotate visually while waiting
- **Map Selection**: Carousel stops on the selected map for next game
- **Call to Action**: Players can place bets to start a game
- **Engaging UX**: Keeps players engaged while waiting

#### Game Flow

**Triggered by Convex creating a game:**

1. **Game Creation**: Convex calls `create_game_round` instruction
   - Game status = **WAITING** (no bets yet)
   - **NO countdown** (start_date = 0, end_date = 0)
   - **NO VRF requested** (cost optimization!)
   - Lock system to prevent concurrent games
   - Map selected (carousel stops)

2. **First Player Bets**: User calls `bet` instruction
   - Status changes: **WAITING → OPEN**
   - **Countdown STARTS**: end_date = now + round_time (e.g., 60s)
   - Adds first bet (SOL transferred to game vault)
   - **NO VRF requested** (VRF is deferred to end_game)

3. **Additional Players Bet**: More users call `bet` instruction
   - Adds more bets (SOL transferred)
   - **NO VRF requested yet** (deferred to end_game)

4. **Countdown Expires**: Convex calls `end_game` (first call)
   - **Single player**: Uses deterministic seed, returns winner immediately
   - **Multiple players**: Requests Magic Block VRF, returns early
   - Sets `vrf_requested = true`

5. **VRF Callback**: Magic Block VRF calls `vrf_callback`
   - Stores randomness in `game.rand`
   - Executed within seconds

6. **Convex calls `end_game` again** (second call, ~3s later)
   - Uses stored VRF randomness to select winner
   - Game status = CLOSED
   - **Multiple players**: 5% house fee

7. **Prize Distribution**: Convex calls `send_prize_winner`
   - 95% to winner (or 100% for single player refund)
   - 5% to treasury (multi-player only)

8. **Return to Carousel**: All clients return to map carousel

#### Game Flow Summary

All games follow this **optimized flow**:

1. **WAITING** (Map Carousel)
   - Carousel spins, showing available maps
   - Players can place bets anytime
   - Convex creates game when ready

2. **GAME CREATION** (Convex creates game)
   - Status = WAITING
   - No bets, no countdown, no VRF
   - Carousel stops on selected map

3. **FIRST BET** (countdown starts)
   - Status: WAITING → OPEN
   - start_date = now, end_date = now + 60s
   - First bet stored, NO VRF request

4. **BETTING PHASE** (up to 60 seconds)
   - More players can join via `bet` instruction
   - Each bet includes: amount, skin (character), position (spawn coords)
   - NO VRF requested during betting (deferred to end_game)

5. **GAME END - FIRST CALL** (Convex calls end_game)
   - **Single player**: Deterministic seed, winner selected immediately
   - **Multi-player**: VRF requested, returns early with "call again in 3s"
   - Sets `vrf_requested = true` for multi-player

6. **VRF CALLBACK** (Magic Block responds)
   - `vrf_callback` instruction called automatically
   - Stores randomness in `game.rand`

7. **GAME END - SECOND CALL** (Convex calls end_game again)
   - Uses stored VRF randomness
   - Weighted selection: bigger bet = higher chance
   - Game status = CLOSED
   - Winner determined, prize calculated

8. **PRIZE DISTRIBUTION** (Convex calls send_prize_winner)
   - Winner receives 95% (or 100% if solo)
   - Treasury receives 5% (multi-player only)

9. **RETURN TO CAROUSEL**
   - System unlocked
   - Carousel resumes spinning
   - Ready for next game

#### Core Features

- **Map Carousel**: Engaging spinning carousel while waiting for games
- **Convex-Managed Games**: Backend creates games, players place bets
- **VRF Cost Optimization**: VRF only requested in end_game for multi-player games
- **Single Player Refunds**: Full refund with 0% fee if only 1 player
- **Multiple Maps**: Carousel displays available maps (bg1, bg2)
- **Character System**: 8 characters available (some NFT-gated)
- **Bet-to-size**: Character size scales with bet amount
- **Helius Webhooks**: Blockchain events → Convex → Frontend via WebSocket
- **Magic Block VRF**: Cheap, fast verifiable randomness

### Betting System

- **Self-Betting Only**: Players bet on themselves during waiting phase
- **Multiple Bets Per Player**: Limits based on bet size (20-30 bets max)
- **Currency**: Native SOL (no conversion, direct betting)
- **Betting Limits**:
  - Minimum: 0.001 SOL (hardcoded constant)
  - Maximum: Configurable (set by admin in `initialize_config`)
  - Recommended: 0.01 SOL min, 10 SOL max
- **Embedded Wallets**: Privy manages user wallets seamlessly
- **Smart Contract Escrow**: All bets locked in on-chain program (non-custodial)
- **Pool Distribution**:
  - **Multi-player**: 95% to winner, 5% house fee
  - **Single player**: 100% refund, 0% house fee
- **Trustless**: Funds secured by smart contract, automatic payouts

### Technical Features

- **Events-Based Sync**: Helius webhooks → Convex → Frontend
- **Type-safe**: End-to-end TypeScript
- **Responsive**: Mobile and desktop support
- **Scalable**: Serverless architecture (Convex)
- **Non-custodial**: Smart contract holds funds, not backend
- **Seamless Auth**: Privy embedded wallets (email/social login)
- **Signless UX**: Privy handles transaction signing smoothly
- **Verifiable**: Magic Block VRF randomness on-chain

crons.interval("cleanup-old-scheduled-jobs", { hours: 6 },
  internal.gameSchedulerMutations.cleanupOldJobs
);
```

### Key Functions

**gameScheduler.ts**
- `createGameRound()` - Calls smart contract create_game_round instruction
- `executeEndGame()` - Calls smart contract end_game instruction
- `executeSendPrize()` - Calls smart contract send_prize_winner instruction

**gameSchedulerMutations.ts**
- Job tracking (prevent duplicates)
- Status updates (pending → completed/failed)
- Cleanup old jobs (older than 24 hours)

### Real-time Features

- Helius webhook listens for program events
- Events stored in Convex database
- Frontend subscribes to Convex via WebSocket (<1s updates)
- Automatic UI updates via Convex React hooks

## VRF Integration (Magic Block)

### Magic Block VRF Overview

**Provider**: Magic Block (ephemeral rollup VRF)
**SDK**: `ephemeral-vrf-sdk`
**Cost**: Much cheaper than Orao VRF (~90% savings)

### VRF Flow

1. **Betting Phase** (no VRF)
   - All bets placed via `bet` instruction
   - NO VRF request during betting (saves cost!)
   - **Single player games**: Will never request VRF

2. **VRF Request** (in end_game, multi-player only)
   - When countdown expires, Convex calls `end_game`
   - If `user_count > 1` and `!vrf_requested`:
     - Requests VRF via `create_request_randomness_ix` from SDK
     - Sets `vrf_requested = true`
     - Returns early: "Call end_game again in 3 seconds"
   - **Single player**: Uses deterministic seed, completes immediately

3. **Callback Execution** (automatic)
   - Magic Block VRF calls `vrf_callback` instruction
   - Stores randomness in `game.rand`
   - Executed within seconds

4. **Winner Selection** (end_game second call)
   - Convex calls `end_game` again (~3s later)
   - Uses `game.rand` from callback
   - Weighted selection: higher bets = higher win chance

5. **Verification**
   - Magic Block provides verifiable randomness
   - On-chain callback ensures integrity

### Why Magic Block VRF?

- **Cost-Optimized**: ~90% cheaper than Orao VRF
- **Deferred Request**: Only triggered in end_game (not during betting)
- **Fast**: Sub-second callback execution
- **Verifiable**: Cryptographic proofs on-chain
- **Ephemeral Rollup**: Optimized for low-cost operations

### Winner Selection Algorithm

```rust
// Pseudo-code (implemented in smart contract)
1. Check player count
2. If single player: use deterministic seed, full refund
3. If multiple players: use Magic Block VRF randomness
4. Calculate total pool (sum of all bet amounts)
5. Random point = randomness % total_pool
6. Iterate through bets, accumulate weights
7. Winner = first bet where cumulative >= random_point
8. Calculate prize (95% pool for multi-player, 100% for solo)
```

**Example (Multi-Player)**:
- Bet 1: 1 SOL (weight: 1)
- Bet 2: 3 SOL (weight: 3)
- Bet 3: 1 SOL (weight: 1)
- Total: 5 SOL
- Random point: 3.7
- Cumulative: 0→1 (Bet 1), 1→4 (Bet 2), 4→5 (Bet 3)
- Winner: Bet 2 (because 3.7 falls in range 1-4)
- Prize: 4.75 SOL (95%), House: 0.25 SOL (5%)

**Example (Single Player)**:
- Bet 1: 2 SOL
- Deterministic seed (no VRF)
- Winner: Player 1 (only player)
- Prize: 2 SOL (100%), House: 0 SOL (0%)

## Frontend Architecture

### Game Phases (GamePhaseManager)

```typescript
enum GamePhase {
  IDLE = "idle",              // Show map carousel
  WAITING = "waiting",        // Accepting bets (countdown running)
  VRF_PENDING = "vrf_pending", // Waiting for end_game
  CELEBRATING = "celebrating", // Winner celebration (15s)
  FIGHTING = "fighting",      // Battle animations
  CLEANUP = "cleanup"         // Preparing for next game
}
```

### Map Carousel (Waiting State)

When no game is active, players see the **map carousel**:

- **Spinning Animation**: Maps rotate continuously
- **Visual Engagement**: Keeps players interested while waiting
- **Map Preview**: Shows available arenas (bg1, bg2)
- **Stops on Selection**: When game is created, carousel stops on selected map
- **Bet Prompt**: UI encourages players to place bets

### Key React Hooks

**usePrivyWallet.ts**
- Manages Privy wallet connection
- Returns: `connected`, `publicKey`, `solBalance`, `wallet`

**useGameContract.ts**
- `placeBet(amount, skin, position)` - Send bet transaction
- `validateBet(amount)` - Check bet validity
- Builds Anchor instructions manually
- Signs via Privy's `signAndSendAllTransactions()`
- Supports `bet` instruction (Convex creates games)

**useNFTCharacters.ts**
- Checks NFT ownership for exclusive characters
- Calls `verifyNFTOwnership` Convex action

- **Total Backend Cost**: ~0.000015 SOL (~$0.003 at $200/SOL)
- **House Fee**: 0% (full refund)

**Multi-Player (2+ bets)**:
- Create game: ~0.000005 SOL
- Magic Block VRF: ~0.00001 SOL (cheap!)
- End game: ~0.000005 SOL
- Send prize: ~0.000005 SOL
- **Total Backend Cost**: ~0.000025 SOL (~$0.005 at $200/SOL)
- **House Fee**: 5% of pool

**Per Player Costs** (User pays):
- Bet transaction: ~0.000005 SOL (~$0.001)

**Economic Model**:
- House edge: 5% of pool (multi-player) or 0% (single player)
- Example: 10 SOL pool = 0.5 SOL house fee (~$100)
- Backend cost: ~$0.005
- Net profit: ~$99.995 per multi-player game
- Scalability: Costs stay flat, revenue scales with pool size

### Cost Comparison (Old vs New)

| Scenario | Old (Orao VRF) | New (Magic Block) | Savings |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| Single player | ~$0.025 | ~$0.003 | **88%** |
| Multi-player | ~$0.025 | ~$0.005 | **80%** |

```

## Security

- Never commit secrets or private keys
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs on-chain
- Smart contract enforces all game rules
- Non-custodial: Backend cannot access player funds
- Verifiable: Magic Block VRF provides cryptographic proofs
- Helius webhooks for secure event monitoring

### Key Architectural Decisions

**1. Hybrid On/Off-Chain**
- ✅ Bets: On-chain (trustless escrow)
- ✅ VRF: On-chain (Magic Block VRF, cost-optimized)
- ✅ Game Creation: Convex-managed (off-chain trigger)
- ✅ Game Logic: Off-chain (fast, flexible)
- ✅ Animations: Off-chain (smooth, no blockchain lag)

**2. Single Global Game**
- One game instance for entire platform
- Creates urgency and social dynamics
- Simpler architecture than parallel games
- Map carousel while waiting for players

**3. Direct SOL (No Tokens)**
- Users bet real SOL, not internal currency
- Clearer value proposition
- Less code complexity
- No conversion confusion

**4. Privy for Wallets**
- Email/social login (no crypto knowledge required)
- Embedded wallets (seamless transaction signing)
- Users control keys (can export)
- 1-2 second bet confirmations

**5. Magic Block VRF (Cost-Optimized)**
- Ephemeral rollup VRF (~90% cheaper than Orao)
- Deferred request (only in end_game for multi-player)
- Single player games: NO VRF (100% savings)
- Fast callback execution (sub-second)

**6. Smart Contract Escrow**
- Non-custodial (backend can't steal)
- Transparent (all bets on-chain)
- Verifiable (Magic Block VRF proofs)
- Marketing advantage (provably fair)

**7. Events-Based Architecture**
- Helius webhooks for blockchain events
- Convex stores and broadcasts events
- Frontend subscribes via WebSocket
- No polling, no active_game PDA needed

## Notes

### What's Implemented
✅ Map carousel (engaging waiting state)
✅ Real game mode (Convex-managed)
✅ Magic Block VRF integration (cost-optimized)
✅ 7-instruction smart contract (optimized)
✅ Privy wallet integration (seamless UX)

✅ Smart explosion effects (winner stays)
✅ Non-custodial escrow
✅ Dynamic prize distribution (95/5 or 100/0)
✅ VRF cost optimization (deferred to end_game)
✅ Single player full refund (0% house fee)

### Removed/Simplified
❌ Demo mode (replaced with map carousel)
❌ active_game PDA (events-based sync instead)
❌ Orao VRF (replaced with Magic Block)
❌ VRF during betting (deferred to end_game)
❌ Fixed house fee (0% for solo, 5% for multi)
❌ Blockchain polling (Helius webhooks instead)

### Key Optimizations
✅ **VRF Cost**: 80-90% reduction vs Orao VRF
✅ **Single Player**: 100% VRF cost savings (no request)
✅ **Architecture**: Simplified (no active_game PDA)
✅ **Events**: Real-time via Helius webhooks
✅ **Fairness**: Single player full refund (0% fee)

### Flow Confirmed
✅ Map carousel spins while waiting for players
✅ Convex creates game (carousel stops on map)
✅ First bet starts countdown (60s)
✅ Betting phase: players place bets (no VRF)
✅ Countdown expires → end_game (1st call)
✅ Single player: full refund, deterministic seed (immediate)
✅ Multi-player: VRF requested in end_game, returns early
✅ VRF callback stores randomness
✅ Convex calls end_game again (2nd call, ~3s later)
✅ Multi-player: 95/5 split, VRF randomness
✅ Prize sent → return to carousel
✅ Carousel resumes, ready for next game

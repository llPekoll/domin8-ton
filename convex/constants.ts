 *
 * This is a continuous loop - no demo mode:
 *
 *  1. MAP_CAROUSEL → Rolling backgrounds, waiting for game creation
 *  2. INSERT_COIN (status=2) → Game created, waiting for first bet
 *  3. BETTING (status=0) → First bet placed, BETTING_COUNTDOWN countdown
 *  4. END_GAME → Cron calls end_game instruction
 *  5. SEND_PRIZE → Prize sent to winner after SEND_PRIZE_DELAY
 *  6. CREATE_NEXT_GAME → New game created after CREATE_GAME_DELAY
